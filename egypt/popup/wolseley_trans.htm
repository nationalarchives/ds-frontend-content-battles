					<ul class="tabbedtable">

						<li>6 Troops and Companies of Royal Engineers,</li>

					<p class="bodytext">Her Majesty's Government do not wish to fetter your discretion as to the particular military operations which may be necessary, but the main object of the Expedition is to re-establish the power of the Khedive.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Her Majesty's Government empower you, after successful operations against Arabi and those in arms against His Highness the Khedive, to enter into any military convention which the circumstances warrant, but no arrangements involving a political settlement should be made by you. It will be desirable, should time and circumstances admit, that the terms of any convention should be referred to.</p>

					<p class="bodytext">Sir Beauchamp Seymour will be instructed to co-operate with you, and render you every assistance in his power.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Her Majesty's Government consider that the protection of the Suez Canal should be undertaken by the Fleet; you will communicate with the Admiral on this point and ascertain his arrangements.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Her Majesty's Consul-General in Egypt should be the medium of any communications which you may deem necessary to make to His Highness the Khedive.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">I am &amp;c.,<br />HUGH C.E. CHILDERS.</p>
