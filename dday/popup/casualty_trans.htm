Capt[ain] JK Morrison and Capt CG Craig were attached to unit supernumerary to establishment. We have been fortunate in the Bde not to have had any M[edical]O[fficer] casualties. Capt Dickson relieved Capt Huckvale of the Regina Rif[les] in order to give the latter a deserving rest. Casualties cleared today 56.</td>

We had our best night last night having no casualties cleared to ADS from 1100 h[ou]rs 13 Jun to 0800 hrs 14 Jun. Although the front line troops are getting more rest the tension is still there but morale is high. Our area is gradually becoming more and more comfortable &quot;like home&quot;. Stoves for heating hot water for having baths etc have been erected. There is no water problem as we are situated on a small river, the river THUE.<br /><br />
		Capt Murphy relieved Capt Caldwell of the R[oyal] W[inni]p[e]g Rif. He has done an excellent job and deserves a rest. A few recommendations for awards was submitted today. I hope they are approved.<br /><br />
        A house &frac14; mile south of our ADS was taken over and is being set up by 6 section as an exhaustion centre. Capt Morrison is in charge. The Div[isional] Neuropsychiatrist Major Gregory is the advisor. It affords ample room, pleasant surroundings, and a large garden and sports field which should help to occupy the minds of the patients.</td>
