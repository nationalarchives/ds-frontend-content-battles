					<h2>Allegations of brainwashing</h2>
					<h3>Page 1 of 2</h3>
					<p class="bodytext"><b><u>TOP SECRET</u></b></p>
					<div align="center"><h2 align="center">Statement made by Lieut[enant]. Colonel J.P. Carne, D.S.O.<br />The Gloucestershire Regiment.</h2></div>
					<p class="bodytext">Colonel Carne came to see me this morning accompanied by Captain Farrar-Hockley, his former Adjutant who was captured with him. Mr. Silverwood-Cope attended the meeting.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">It appears that from January 1952 to August 19th, 1953, Lieutenant Colonel Carne was kept in solitary confinement and subjected to treatment by the Communists, including drugs, which made his brain, as he put it, like a sponge capable of absorbing anything. Far from seeking information during this period the Communists seemed bent on giving it to him, but the whole process was so confusing (apparently by intention) that Colonel Carne was unable to be very precise, even though he is certain that he was meant to record what he told me. After this process and after the Armistice had been signed, he was brought before a Chinese General who formally told him about the Armistice. He asked the General whether he was meant to pass on what he had been told, to which the General said he knew nothing about that, but if Colonel Carne had anything to tell he should tell his own people when he got back. 
						Just before the Armistice, his Adjutant, Captain Farrar-Hockley, was arrested on a trumped-up charge that he had plotted the assassination of the Camp Commandant (who was actually fired at several times by a Korean) and sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment. He was told of the sentence just after the Armistice, and was then told that the sentence would be remitted if he consented to become a Chinese agent and to provide information about U.S. military forces. This incident will be the subject of a separate report, but Colonel Carne and Captain Farrar-Hockley apparently think there is a relation between it and the information communicated to the former.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">This was as follows:-</p>
					<p class="bodytext">(a) The Chinese would like the early unification of Korea but if this is not possible, they want a buffer zone larger than the present one which should be policed by Chinese and British forces. They would accept a British Command and, at a pinch, only British forces.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">(b) They would like the United Kingdom to undertake the reconstruction of both North and South Korea.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">(b) The price the Chinese would be prepared to pay for the good offices of the United Kingdom would be:-</p>
